Hi all,
I tried to re-engineering the SCP (Stulz Protocol of the newer Controller c7000-range) and had great results.
It is working fine with reading and writing values.
Ok, some special communications are not now implemented, like token and so on.
But I can say it will work and you can be sure that you are not wasting your time if you implemented in your system.
If you need more details or help do not hesitate to contact me :-)

Of course in the code you see also SDC (it is the old controller protocol from Stulz), it is not finished, therefore you can try...
